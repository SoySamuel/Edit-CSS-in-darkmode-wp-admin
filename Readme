This code changes the way wp-admin is seen by the web designer. With dark mode, it is more relaxed for the eyes of all of those who prefer dark mode but the WordPress theme does not put the additional CSS editor in dark mode. 

To introduce this code:

1. install a plugin like Admin CSS MU:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-css-mu/

it is very easy to use, just after installing the plugin.

2. Clic "Add CSS" and paste the code. 

3. Make sure Load Admin CSS is marked and Save CSS. 

THEMES:
Designed in Blocksy, tested in Astra, and Hello Elementor. It doesnÂ´t change anything in Twenty-Twenty Three or Twenty-Twenty Four... and subsequent, for which we need to change the classes.
